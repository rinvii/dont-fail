# Pointer Arithmetic

In [Pointer Fundamentals](/docs/pointers/pointer-fundamentals), we learned that pointers are variables that store memory addresses. In [Arrays](/docs/c-mechanics/arrays), we learned that arrays contain a sequence of elements of the same type. As it turns out, pointers can point to those array elements. We will go more in-depth on this topic in the next page: [Pointers and Arrays](/docs/pointers/pointers-and-arrays).

<Callout>Pointers can point to array elements.</Callout>

For example, consider the following array and pointer:

```c
int numbers[5];
int *p = numbers; // p points to the first element of numbers, same as int *p = &numbers[0];
// after
p = &numbers[2];  // p now points to the third element of numbers
```

The diagram below shows what we did in the memory:

<Callout type="info">
  Each memory address is 4 bytes apart from each other. This is because each
  `int` is 4 bytes in size. The other bytes are omitted for simplicity.
</Callout>

Pointing and assigning to different element memory addresses alone is not very useful. What is useful is the ability to perform arithmetic on pointers. This is called **pointer arithmetic**.

In C, there are **only three** forms of pointer arithmetic: adding an integer to a pointer, subtracting an integer from a pointer, and subtracting one pointer from another. Let's look at each of these in detail.

## Adding an Integer to Pointer

We can add an integer to a pointer to move the pointer.

For example:

```c {3}
int numbers[5];
int *p = numbers;
p = p + 2; // p now points to the third element of numbers
```

Be cautious when performing arithmetic on a pointer because it is possible to go out of bounds of the array. For example, if we add 5 to `p`, it will point to the sixth element of `numbers`, which is out of bounds. This is undefined behavior.

  Performing arithmetic on a pointer can cause undefined behavior if the pointer
  goes out of bounds of the array.

## Subtracting an Integer from a Pointer

Subtracting is simple:

```c {4}
int numbers[5];
int *p = &numbers[4]; // p points to the last element of numbers
int *q = &numbers[2]; // q points to the third element of numbers
p = p - 2;            // p now points to the third element of numbers
```

The example above has both `p` and `q` pointing to the third element of `numbers`.

## Subtracting One Pointer from Another

When subtracting pointers from each other, the result is the distance between the two pointers in terms of the number of elements. For example:

```c {4,5}
int numbers[5];
int *p = &numbers[4];          // p points to the last element of numbers
int *q = &numbers[2];          // q points to the third element of numbers
int distance = p - q;          // distance is 2
int negative_distance = q - p; // negative_distance is -2
```

## Comparing Pointers

We can compare pointers using relational operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) and equality operators (`==`, `!=`). The outcome of the comparison depends on the relative positions of the pointers in memory. For example:

```c {6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26}
int numbers[5];
int *p = &numbers[4]; // p points to the last element of numbers
int *q = &numbers[2]; // q points to the third element of numbers

if (p > q) {
  printf("p is greater than q\n");             // this will be printed
}

if (p < q) {
  printf("p is less than q\n");                // this will NOT be printed
}

if (p >= q) {
  printf("p is greater than or equal to q\n"); // this will be printed
}

if (p <= q) {
  printf("p is less than or equal to q\n");    // this will NOT be printed
}

if (p == q) {
  printf("p is equal to q\n");                 // this will NOT be printed
}

if (p != q) {
  printf("p is not equal to q\n");             // this will be printed
}
```

Remember, pointers are just memory addresses. When comparing pointers, we are comparing the memory addresses.
