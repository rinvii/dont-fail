# Mac Setup

I've heard some people argue that MacBooks are bad for development. Most people that I've heard say this come from Windows. Think of that what you will.

Aside from that, I've found that Macs are great for development. They're Unix-based, so you can use all the same tools that you would on a Linux machine (most of them).

Points to consider:

- **Operating System:** MacBooks run MacOS, which is Unix-based, making it a popular choice for developers. If you have background in Linux, you'll feel right at home.
- **Price:** MacBooks are expensive. You can get a Windows laptop with the same specs for much cheaper. However, MacBooks are known for their longevity. I've had my MacBook Air for 3 years now, and it's still going strong.
- **Size:** MacBooks are small and light. They're easy to carry around, and they don't take up much space on your desk.
- **Aesthetic:** MacBooks are sleek and stylish. They look good, and they feel good to use.
