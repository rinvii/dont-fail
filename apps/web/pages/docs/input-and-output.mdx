# Input and Output

The term **stream** refers to any source of input or any destination for output. All streams are **file pointers** of type `FILE *`. The standard library provides three predefined streams:

| File Pointer | Stream          | Description |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------- |
| `stdin`      | Standard input  | Keyboard    |
| `stdout`     | Standard output | Screen      |
| `stderr`     | Standard error  | Screen      |

  Note that the File Pointer column are just variable names reserved by C.

## Formatted I/O

Formatted I/O is the process of reading and writing data in **format strings**. Format strings are strings that may contain one or both: ordinary characters and **conversion specifications**. Ordinary characters are copied to the output stream as is. Conversion specifications are replaced by a value of the specified conversion.

### `printf` Family of Functions

`printf` and `fprintf` are the two most commonly used functions for formatted output which can be included using the `stdio.h` header file: `#include <stdio.h>{:c}`. `printf` writes to the `stdout` (standard output), while `fprintf` writes to a specified stream.

<Callout>
  The `stdio.h` header file is the standard input/output header file. It
  contains all the functions and macros for input and output that are mentioned
  in this page. Remember to include it at the top of your program.
</Callout>

`printf` is just a wrapper function for `fprintf` that writes to `stdout`.

The following two lines are equivalent:

```c
printf("Hello, world!\n");
fprintf(stdout, "Hello, world!\n");
```

`printf` and `fprintf` have the following prototype:

```c
int printf(const char * restrict format, ...);
int fprintf(FILE * restrict stream, const char * restrict format, ...);
```

The elipses indicate that the functions can take any number of arguments. The first argument is a format string, and the remaining arguments are values to be converted.

For example:

```c
printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
fprintf(stdout, "Hello, %s!\n", "world");
```

Both functions return the number of characters written to the stream, or a negative value if an error occurs.

### `scanf` Family of Functions

`scanf` and `fscanf` read from `stdin` and a specified stream respectively. Just like `printf` and `fprintf`, `scanf` is just a wrapper function for `fscanf` that reads from `stdin`.

They have the following prototype:

```c
int scanf(const char *restrict format, ...);
int fscanf(FILE *restrict stream, const char *restrict format, ...);
```

They return the number of input items successfully matched and assigned, or `EOF` if an error occurs before any conversion.

`EOF` is a macro defined in `stdio.h` that expands to an integer constant expression with a negative value. It's used to indicate the end of a file.

## File Operations

In C, files are represented by a pointer of type `FILE *`.

### Opening Files

To open a file, we use the `fopen` function. It has the following prototype:

```c
FILE *fopen(const char *restrict filename, const char *restrict mode);
```

`fopen` returns a file pointer (a stream) to the opened file, or `NULL` if an error occurs.

For example, to open a file named `hello.txt` in the current directory for reading:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  FILE *fp = fopen("hello.txt", "r");

  if (fp == NULL) {
    return 1;
  }



  fclose(fp);
  fp = NULL;

  return 0;
}
```

Notice that we check if `fp` is `NULL` before using it. This is because `fopen` returns `NULL` if an error occurs.

<Callout type="warning">
  Always check if `fopen` returns `NULL` before using the file pointer.
</Callout>

### Modes

The second argument to `fopen` is a string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened.

The following table lists the possible modes for text files:

| String | Description                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"r"`  | Open for reading                                       |
| `"w"`  | Open for writing (file need not exist)                 |
| `"a"`  | Open for appending (file need not exist)               |
| `"r+"` | Open for reading and writing, starting at beginning    |
| `"w+"` | Open for reading and writing (truncate if file exists) |
| `"a+"` | Open for reading and appending (file need not exist)   |

The following table lists the possible modes for binary files:

### Closing Files

To close a file, we use the `fclose` function. It has the following prototype:

```c
int fclose(FILE *stream);
```

`fclose` returns `0` if the file is successfully closed, or `EOF` if an error occurs.

Closing files takes in a file pointer associated with an open file and ensures any buffered data is written out, system resources are freed, and the association between the file and file pointer is terminated.

Although the example [above](/docs/input-and-output#opening-files) closes the file, it can be improved to be more safe. For example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  FILE *fp = fopen("hello.txt", "r");

  if (fp == NULL) {
    return 1;
  }
  // ...

  if (fclose(fp) == EOF) {
    return 1;
  }
  fp = NULL;

  return 0;
}
```

### Getting File Names from the Command Line

We can open and close files, but how do we supply the file name to `fopen`? One way is to hardcode the file name in the program, but this is not very flexible. A better way is to get the file name from the command line.

To obtain file names from the command line, we use the arguments passed to the `main` function. The `main` function has the following prototype:

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
// or
int main(int argc, char **argv);
```

- `argc` is the number of arguments passed to the program.
- `argv` is an array of strings containing the arguments passed to the program.

The first argument, `argv[0]`, is the name of the program being executed. The remaining arguments are the arguments passed to the program. Therefore, the actual arguments passed to the program begin from `argv[1]`.

For example, if we run the following command:

```bash
./program hello.txt
```

`argc` will be `2` and `argv` will be:

```c filename="program.c"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc != 2) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <filename>\n", argv[0]);
      return 1;
    }

  printf("argc: %d\n", argc);       // prints argc: 2
  printf("argv[0]: %s\n", argv[0]); // prints argv[0]: ./program
  printf("argv[1]: %s\n", argv[1]); // prints argv[1]: hello.txt

  const char *filename = argv[1];
  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "r");

  if (fp == NULL) {
      perror("Error opening file"); // prints to stderr
      return 1;
  }

  // ... Perform operations on the file

  fclose(fp);

  return 0;
}
```
