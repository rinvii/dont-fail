# Strings

We know how to create a character using the `char` keyword. But what if we want to create a word? Or a sentence? Or a paragraph? Or a book? Or a library? Or a whole universe?

In C, there are no special types for these things. Instead, we use arrays of characters to represent them. These arrays are called **strings**.

This page will discuss the fundamentals of strings in C and the C string library. If you're looking for string applications in the context of user and/or file-based interaction, check out the [Input and Output](/docs/input-and-output) page.

This page also covers pointers. You can learn more about the fundamentals of pointers [here](/docs/pointers/pointer-fundamentals) before you continue. It's not required, but it will help you understand the content on this page.

In this page, we differentiate strings from characters by using **double quotes** (`"`) for strings and **single quotes** (`'`) for characters.

## String Literals

A **string literal** is a sequence of characters enclosed in **double quotes** (`"`). For example, `"Hello, world!"` is a string literal.

<Callout type="warning">
  String literals must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are used to
  denote a single character.
</Callout>

If a string literal is too long to fit on one line, **you can continue it to the next line** by using the `\` character at the end of each line. For example:

```c
"This is a very long string \
that spans multiple lines."
```

This technique is useful for making your code more readable, but has one drawback: it may conflict with the indentation.

```c
if (condition) {
    "This is a very long string \
    that spans multiple lines."
}
```

Notice that we aligned the second line with the first line, but in doing so, we introduced extra whitespace into the string in its entirety:

The example above is equivalent to:

```c
if (condition) {
    "This is a very long string    that spans multiple lines."
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Using the `\` technique for string literals must require the string to
  continue at the beginning of the line.
</Callout>

If this indentation issue is a problem for you, you can join create string literals that are adjacent to each other. For example:

```c
if (condition) {
    "This is a very long string "
    "that spans multiple lines."
    // same as "This is a very long string that spans multiple lines."
}
```

The compiler will automatically join adjacent string literals into one string literal.

For example, the compiler will accept this:

```c
printf("Hello, \n"
       "world!"); // same as printf("Hello, \nworld!");
```

### Underlying Memory of String Literals

When we supply a string literal to arguments like `printf("Hello, world!)`, what are we actually passing to the function? To understand this, we need to understand how string literals are stored in memory.

<Callout>
  In C, a string literal is just an array of characters of size `n + 1`. The
  extra character is the **null character** represented by the escape sequence
  `\0`.
</Callout>

So what happens whenever we create a string literal? Let's take a look at the following code:

```c
int main() {
    "Hello, world!";
    // Realistically, this isn't very useful. If compiled with optimization
    // flags, this code will not allocate any memory.
    return 0;
}
```

When the program reaches the string literal, it will allocate `n + 1` bytes into a **read-only section of memory**. `n` is the number of characters, but since strings are null-terminated, we need to allocate an extra byte for the null character.

The diagram below shows the memory layout of the string literal `"Hello, world!"`:

<Bleed>
  ![Memory Layout of String Literal](/string-literal-memory-diagram.jpg)
</Bleed>

So now that we know how string literals work, we can understand how they are passed to functions. When we pass a string literal to a function, we are actually passing an **address to the string** which is a pointer to the first character. For example:

```c
int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!");
    // The string literal "Hello, world!" is passed to printf as a pointer to
    // the first character of the string which is 'H'.
    return 0;
}
```

## String Variables (Arrays of Characters)

We know how to create a string literal, but what if we want to create a **string variable**? In the [Arrays](/docs/c-mechanics/arrays) page, we learned how to create an arrays of integers. Here we find out solidify our understanding that strings are just arrays of characters.

In this section, we'll learn how to create arrays of characters. For example:

```c
char my_string[6]; // allocate an array of 6 characters
```

We can initialize the array with a string literal:

```c
char my_string[6] = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'];
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Noitice that we need to include the null character at the end of the array.
  Which is why we need to allocate an array of size `n + 1` to store a word of
  size `n`. In this case, we need to allocate an array of size 6 to store a word
  of size 5.
</Callout>

We can also initialize the array with a string literal:

```c
char my_string[6] = "Hello";

// even better, let the compiler figure out the size of the string literal

char my_string[] = "Hello";
```

The code above shows a string literal `"Hello"` **being copied** into the array `my_string`. The null character is also copied into the array.

Note that the array `my_string` is **not** a string literal. It is an array of characters that contains a copy of the string literal `"Hello"`.

These strings are called **mutable strings** because we can change the contents of the array. For example:

```c
char my_string[] = "Hello";
my_string[0] = 'h'; // change the first character to 'h'

printf("%s", my_string); // prints "hello"
```

### Mutability of Strings

Just now we learned that we can change the contents of a string variable which is an array of characters. But what about string literals?

<Callout>
  String literals are stored in a read-only section of memory and are therefore
  immutable. Therefore, we cannot change the contents of a string literal.
</Callout>

For example, these two strings are not the same:

```c
char my_string[] = "Hello";
char *my_string = "Hello";
```

The first string copies the string literal `"Hello"` into the array `my_string`. The second string creates a pointer `my_string` that points to the string literal `"Hello"`. Learn more about pointers [here](/docs/pointers/pointer-fundamentals).

## C String Library Functions

The C string library is a collection of functions that operate on strings. These functions are declared in the header file `string.h`. To use these functions, we need to include the header file:

```c
#include <string.h>
```

### String Manipulation

#### `strcpy` (String Copy)

Copies the contents of one string (including the null terminator) to another and returns the destination string.

```c
char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);
```

`strcpy` accepts two arguments: `dest` and `src`. `dest` is the destination string and `src` is the source string, and returns the destination string.

```c
char src[] = "Hello";
char dest[sizeof(src)]; // sizeof returns the size of the array in bytes: 6

strcpy(dest, src);
printf("%s", dest); // prints "Hello"
```

#### `strncpy` (String Copy with Length)

Copies the contents of one string (including the null terminator) to another with a specified length and returns the destination string.

```c
char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
```

`strncpy` accepts three arguments: `dest`, `src`, and `n`.

`dest` is the destination string, `src` is the source string, and `n` is the number of characters to copy.

```c
char dest[] = "_____ World";
char src[] = "Hello";

strncpy(dest, src, strlen(src)); // strlen(src) returns 5

printf("%s", dest); // prints "Hello World"
```

#### `strcat` (String Concatenation)

Concatenates the contents of one string to another and returns the destination string.

<Callout type="error">
  `strcat` behavior is undefined if the destination is not large for both source
  and destination strings. If either source or destination string is not
  null-terminated.
</Callout>

```c
char *strcat(char *dest, const char *src);
```

`strcat` accepts two arguments: `dest` and `src`. `dest` is the destination string and `src` is the source string.

```c
char str1[10] = "Hi ";
// same as char str1[] = {'H', 'i', ' ', '\0'}; rest of the array is '\0'
char str2[] = "Hello";

strcat(str1, str2);

printf("%s", str1); // prints  "Hi Hello"
```

#### `strncat` (String Concatenation with Length)

Concatenates the contents of one string to another with a specified length and returns the destination string.

<Callout type="error">
  `strncat` behavior is undefined if the destination is not large for both
  source and destination strings. If either source or destination string is not
  null-terminated.
</Callout>

```c
char *strncat(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
```

`strncat` accepts three arguments: `dest`, `src`, and `n`.

`dest` is the destination string, `src` is the source string, and `n` is the number of characters to concatenate.

```c
char str1[10] = "Hi ";
char str2[] = "Heyllo";

strncat(str1, str2, 3);

printf("%s", str1); // prints  "Hi Hey"
```

#### `strdup` (String Duplicate)

Duplicates a string and returns a pointer to the new string. The new string is allocated using `malloc` and must be freed using `free` to avoid a memory leak.

```c
char *strdup(const char *s);
```

`strdup` accepts one argument: `s`. `s` is the string to duplicate.

```c
char *str = "Hello";
char *dup = strdup(str);

printf("%s", dup); // prints "Hello"

free(dup); // free the memory allocated by strdup
```

#### `strndup` (String Duplicate with Length)

Duplicates a string with a specified length and returns a pointer to the new string. The new string is allocated using `malloc` and must be freed using `free` to avoid a memory leak.

```c
char *strndup(const char *s, size_t n);
```

`strndup` accepts two arguments: `s` and `n`. `s` is the string to duplicate and `n` is the number of characters to duplicate.

```c
char *str = "Heyllo";
char *dup = strndup(str, 3);

printf("%s", dup); // prints "Hey"

free(dup); // free the memory allocated by strndup
```

### String Inspection

#### `strlen` (String Length)

Returns the length of a string excluding the null terminator.

```c
size_t strlen(const char *s);
```

`strlen` accepts one argument: `s`. `s` is the string to inspect.

```c
char *str = "Hello";

printf("%zu", strlen(str)); // prints 5, %zu is the format specifier for size_t
```

#### `strcmp` (String Comparison)

Compares two strings lexicographically and returns an integer that indicates the relationship between the strings.

```c
int strcmp(const char *lhs, const char *rhs);
```

`strcmp` accepts two arguments: `lhs` and `rhs`. They are pointers to null-terminated strings to compare.

`strcmp` returns an integer that indicates the relationship between the strings:

- `0` if the strings are equal
- `< 0` if `lhs` is less than `rhs`
- `> 0` if `lhs` is greater than `rhs`

```c
char *str1 = "Hello";
char *str2 = "Hello";

printf("%d", strcmp(str1, str2)); // prints 0
```

Less than and greater than are determined by the ASCII value of the first character that differs between the two strings.

```c
char *str1 = "Hello";
char *str2 = "World";
int result = strcmp(str1, str2);

if (result < ) {
    printf("%s is less than %s", str1, str2); // prints
} else {
    printf("%s is greater than %s", str1, str2); // does not print
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Do not concern yourself with the actual value of the integer returned by
  strcmp. It is not guaranteed to be the difference between the ASCII values of
  the first differing characters. Implementations may vary. Instead, use the
  sign of the result to determine the relative order of the strings and check
  for equality with 0.
</Callout>

#### `strncmp` (String Comparison with Length)

Compares two strings lexicographically with a specified length and returns an integer that indicates the relationship between the strings.

```c
int strncmp(const char *lhs, const char *rhs, size_t n);
```

`strncmp` accepts three arguments: `lhs`, `rhs`, and `n`. They are pointers to null-terminated strings to compare and the number of characters to compare.

`strncmp` returns an integer that indicates the relationship between the strings:

- `0` if the strings are equal
- `< 0` if `lhs` is less than `rhs`
- `> 0` if `lhs` is greater than `rhs`

```c
char *str1 = "Hello";
char *str2 = "Heylo";
int result = strncmp(str1, str2, 3);

if (result < ) {
    printf("%s is less than %s", str1, str2); // prints
} else {
    printf("%s is greater than %s", str1, str2); // does not print
}
```

#### `strstr` (String Search)

Find the first occurrence of a substring in a string and returns a pointer to the first character of the substring. If the substring is not found, `NULL` is returned.

```c
char *strstr(const char *haystack, const char *needle);
```

`strstr` accepts two arguments: `haystack` and `needle`. `haystack` is the string to search and `needle` is the substring to search for.

```c
char *str = "Hello, world!";
char *substr = "world";

char *result = strstr(str, substr);

if (result != NULL) {
    printf("Found substring at index %zu", result - str); // prints Found substring at index 7
} else {
    printf("Substring not found");
}
```

### String Conversion

#### `atof` (ASCII to Float)

Defined in `stdlib.h`.

Interprets a string as a floating-point number and returns the result.

```c
double atof(const char *str);
```

`atof` accepts one argument: `str`. `str` is the string to convert.

```c
char *str = "3.14";
double num = atof(str);

printf("%f", num); // prints 3.14
```

#### `atoi` (ASCII to Integer)

Defined in `stdlib.h`.

Interprets a string as an integer and returns the result.

```c
int atoi(const char *str);
```

`atoi` accepts one argument: `str`. `str` is the string to convert.

```c
char *str = "123";

printf("%d", atoi(str)); // prints 123
```

#### `atol` (ASCII to Long)

Defined in `stdlib.h`.

Interprets a string as a long integer and returns the result.

```c
long atol(const char *str);
```

`atol` accepts one argument: `str`. `str` is the string to convert.

```c
char *str = "123456789";

printf("%ld", atol(str)); // prints 123456789
```
