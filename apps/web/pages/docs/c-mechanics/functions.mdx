# Functions

A function is a block of code that can be called to perform a specific task. Functions are used to make code more modular and reusable. Functions can be called from other functions, or from the main program.

They are written as follows:

```c
type function_name(type parameter1_name, type parameter2_name, ...) {
  ...
}
```

They follow the same [naming rules](/docs/c-mechanics/variables#a-word-on-naming-syntax-rules) as variables.

## Function Example

This function takes two integers and prints their sum:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void add(int a, int b) {
  // We invoke printf() which is a function from the standard library
  // that takes the arguments we pass to it and prints them to the console.
  // The format string "%d\n" tells printf() to print the first argument.
  printf("%d\n", a + b);
}

int main() {
  add(1, 2); // Prints 3
  add(3, 4); // Prints 7
  add(5, 6); // Prints 11

  // We invoke the exit() function from the standard library to exit the program.
  // This is equivalent to returning 0 from main().
  exit(0);
}
```

## Function Return Values

Functions can return a value to the caller. The return type is specified before the function name. If the function does not return a value, the return type is `void`. The function above did not return a value, so its return type was `void`.

Here is an example of a function that returns the sum of two integers:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

int main() {
  int sum = add(1, 2);
  printf("%d\n", sum); // Prints 3

  return 0;
}
```

## Function Prototypes

Function prototypes are used to tell the compiler about a function before it is defined. Function declarations at the top of a file are called prototypes:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototype
int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
  int sum = add(1, 2);
  printf("%d\n", sum); // Prints 3

  return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

You can also just declare and define the function at the same time like [above](/docs/c-mechanics/functions#function-return-values)

Why do we need function prototypes? The compiler reads the file from top to bottom. If we call a function before it is defined, the compiler will not know what to do. We can fix this by defining the function before we call it, or by using a function prototype.

In this way, we can declare prototypes in a header file and define the functions in a separate source file so those source files can call each other's functions without having to redefine their functions.

## Return Code of Main

The return code of `main()` is used to tell the operating system whether the program exited successfully or not. A return code of `0` means the program exited successfully. Any other return code means the program exited with an error.
