# Recursion

**Recursion** is a technique for solving problems whereby a program breaks a problem into pieces and calling the program itself to solve each piece.

In order to understand recursion, let's first dive into **mathematical induction.** I promise we won't get deep into the math, but it's important to understand the "why" of recursion.

Induction is a proof technique for proving a statement $P(n)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. That is, for example, if $P(1)$ is true, and if $P(k) \implies P(k+1)$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

In other words, given $P(n)$, we have two cases:

- **Base case:** If $n = 1$ holds true for $P(n)$
- **Induction step:** And if $n = k$ holds true for $P(n)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then $n = k + 1$ must also hold true for $P(n)$

Then $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

That's all the math we need to know. This is all to say that in order to have a **correct** recursive algorithm, it must be able to be proven correct using mathematical induction.

## Defining Our Recursive Algorithm

In induction, we have a base case and an induction step. In recursion, we have a base case and a recursive case.

<Callout>
  Every recursive algorithm must have a base case and a recursive case.
</Callout>

### Base Case

The **base case** is the simplest scenario where the problem can be solved directly without further recursion. It's the stopping condition that prevents the recursion from continuing indefinitely. In your algorithm, you must first define the base case and then define what happens when you reach the base case.

For example, in a recursive algorithm to compute the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, the base case is when `n` is 0, and the result is defined as 1:

```c {3-5}
int factorial(int n) {
    // base case
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
}
```

The reason we return 1 is because $0! = 1$. This is the simplest case where we can solve the problem directly by calling the function with the smallest non-negative integer. Thus, `factorial(0){:c}` must return 1.

### Recursive case

The **recursive case** defines how to break down a larger instance of a problem into one or smaller instances of the same problem, moving closer to the base case. This step often involves calling the same function (or algorithm) recursively with modified input.

Continuing with the factorial example, the recursive step calculates the factorial of `n` based on the factorial of `n - 1`:

```c {8}
int factorial(int n) {
  // base case
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    }

  // recursive case
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

Here, we multiply `n` by the factorial of `n - 1`, which is a step closer to the base case and a smaller instance of the same problem.

### Putting It All Together

With the base case and recursive step defined, the recursive algorithm works by repeatedly breaking down the problem into smaller parts until it reaches the base case. Once the base case is reached, the recursion stops, and the algorithm can compute the final result.

We can visualize this algorithm for computing the factorial of 5:

Recursion can be a powerful technique for solving problems, but it's essential to ensure that your base case and recursive step are well-defined to avoid infinite recursion.

In the following sections, we will explore various examples of recursive algorithms.

{/* REVIEW: there are two inductive proof errors to look for which will help in desigining recursive algorithms, consider writing them */}

## Fibonacci Sequence

The **Fibonacci sequence** is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1, and the sequence continues indefinitely.

I'm personally not a math person, so I will steal the recursive formula from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence):

The Fibonacci numbers may be defined by the recurrence relation $F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1$ and $F_n = F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2}$ for $n > 1$.

A recursive function written in C to compute the $n$th Fibonacci number is as follows:

```c
int fibonacci(int n) {
    // base case
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    // base case
    if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    // recursive case
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

Let's also examine the complexity of our algorithm. For every recursive call, we make two recursive calls. Those two recursive calls each make two recursive calls, and so on. The amount of calls we make: $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow \cdots$ This means that the number of recursive calls grows exponentially with the input size. Thus, the complexity of our algorithm is $O(2^n)$.

<Callout type="info">
  Technically, $F_{n + 1}/F_{n}/\approx \phi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2 \approx 1.61803$.
  This means that the complexity of our algorithm is actually $O(\phi^n)$.
  However, since $\phi$ is a constant, we can drop it and say that the
  complexity is $O(2^n)$.

## Binary Search

Binary search is a classic algorithm for searching for a specific element within a **sorted array**. In this section, we will explore the recursive implementation of binary search.

Before we implement, we have to ensure that:

- The array is sorted
- The array is not empty

Given these facts, we have a sorted array `arr` of size `n` and a target value `target`. We want to find the index of `target` in `arr` if it exists, or return `-1` if it does not exist.

```c
int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target, int start, int end) {
    // base case: target not found
    if (start > end) {
        return -1;
    }

    int mid = (start + end) / 2; // integer division, rounds down 3 / 2 = 1

    // base case: target found
    if (arr[mid] == target) {
        return mid;
    }

    if (arr[mid] < target) {
        // recursive case: search right subarray
        return binarySearch(arr, target, mid + 1, end);
    } else {
        // recursive case: search left subarray
        return binarySearch(arr, target, start, mid);
    }
}
```

Analyzing the complexity of this algorithm, we can see on every recursive call, we are calling the function with half the size of the array. Thus, the complexity of our algorithm is $O(\log n)$.

## Linear Search

Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that iterates through an array and checks if the current element is the target element. If it is, we return the index of the element. If we reach the end of the array without finding the target element, we return `-1`.

Given:

- An array `arr`
- Non-negative integer `size` representing the size of `arr`
- A target value `target`

First we implement it iteratively:

```c
int linearSearch(int[] arr, int size, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == target) {
        return i;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
```

Our recursion implementation:

```c
int linearSearch(int[] arr, int size, int target, int i) {
    // base case: target not found, reached end of array
    if (i == size) {
        return -1;
    }

    // base case: target found
    if (arr[i] == target) {
        return i;
    }

    // recursive case: search next element
    return linearSearch(arr, size, target, i + 1);
}
```

Both implementations have the same complexity: $O(n)$.

## Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). Examples include "radar", "level", "deified", and "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!".

To determine if a string is a palindrome using recursion, we can compare the first and last characters of the string. If they are the same, we can then check the substring that excludes these two characters. We continue this process until we either find a mismatch or the string becomes empty or has a length of 1, indicating that the original string is a palindrome.

Here's a recursive function written in C to check if a given string is a palindrome:

```c
bool isPalindrome(char[] str, int start, int end) {
    // base case: string is empty or has length 1
    if (start >= end) {
        return true;
    }

    // base case: mismatch
    if (str[start] != str[end]) {
        return false;
    }

    // recursive case: check next pair of characters
    return isPalindrome(str, start + 1, end - 1);
}
```

The complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$ because we are checking each character of the string once. This is similar to the linear search algorithm.

## Greatest Common Divisor

The **greatest common divisor** (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.

The Euclidean algorithm is a method for computing the GCD of two integers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until one of the numbers becomes 0. The other number is the GCD.

Here's a recursive function written in C to compute the GCD of two integers:

```c
int gcd(int num1, int num2) {
    // base case: num1 == 0
    if (num1 == 0) {
        return num2;
    }

    // recursive case: num1 > 0
    return gcd(num2 % num1, num1);
}
```

The complexity of this algorithm is $O(\log(\min(a, b)))$ because we are dividing the larger number by the smaller number on every recursive call. This is similar to the binary search algorithm.

## Russian Peasant Multiplication

Russian Peasant Multiplication is an ancient algorithm used to multiply two numbers. It uses the properties of doubling and halving to iteratively break down the multiplication problem into simpler steps.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. If the first number is even, halve it and double the second number.
2. If the first number is odd, add the second number to the result.
3. Repeat the process until the first number becomes 0.

The recursive implementation provided below follows this method. It checks if the first number `num1` is even or odd. If it's even, it halves `num1` and doubles `num2`. If it's odd, it adds `num2` to the result and then halves num1 and doubles `num2`. The recursion continues until `num1` becomes 0.

The algorithm also handles negative numbers by converting them to positive and adjusting the result accordingly.

```c
int russianPeasantMultiply(int num1, int num2) {
    // base case: num1 == 0
    if (num1 == 0) {
        return 0; // multiply by 0
    }

    // recursive case: for negative valued input
    if (num1 < 0 && num2 < 0) {
        return russianPeasantMultiply(-num1, -num2); // negate both inputs
    }

    // recursive case: num1 is negative and num2 is positive
    if (num1 < 0 && num2 > 0) {
        return -russianPeasantMultiply(-num1, num2); // negate result
    }

    // recursive case: num1 is positive and num2 is negative
    if (num1 > 0 && num2 < 0) {
        return -russianPeasantMultiply(num1, -num2); // negate result
    }

    // recursive case: num1 is positive and num2 is positive
    // if num1 is even, halve it and double num2
    // if num1 is odd, add num2 to the result and then halve num1 and double num2
    int result = num1 % 2 == 0 ? russianPeasantMultiply(num1 / 2, num2 * 2) : russianPeasantMultiply(num1 / 2, num2 * 2) + num2;
    return result;
}
```

The complexity of this algorithm is $O(\log n)$ because we are dividing the first number by 2 on every recursive call. This is similar to the binary search algorithm.

## Printing Numbers in Different Bases

Numbers can be represented in various bases, from binary (base 2) to decimal (base 10) and even hexadecimal (base 16). When working with different bases, it's often necessary to convert numbers from one base to another. One way to achieve this is by using a recursive function that breaks down the number into its individual digits in the desired base.

Let's explore a recursive function in C that prints a number in a given base:

```c
void printNumberToBase(int n, int base) {
    // Array to translate between number values and digit-characters
    char digits[] = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";

    // Handle negative numbers
    if (val < 0) {
        printf("-");
        val = -val;  // Convert val to its absolute value
    }

    // Recursive case: val >= base
    if (val >= base) {
        printNumberToBase(val / base, base);
    }

    // Print the current digit (works for both base case and recursive case)
    printf("%c", digits[val % base]);
}
```

The complexity of this algorithm is $O(\log)$ because we are dividing the number by the base on every recursive call.

## Further Learning

This page should be a good introduction to recursion. Let this be a stepping stone to analyze other recursive algorithms used in other places of this website. We will see recursion again in the following pages:
