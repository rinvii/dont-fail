# Overview

Learning data structures can be hard. The challenges aren't just limited to grasping complex concepts.

## Why?

Did you fail a test? Did you get a bad grade on an assignment? Are you struggling to understand a concept? Are you just looking for a place to start?

For many, the real struggle begins when:

- **Scattered Resources**: Sifting through disparate assignments, readings, and references can eat up valuable study time.

- **Juggling Responsibilities**: Whether it's a demanding job, familial duties, or other academic pressures, managing time becomes a task in itself.

- **Time Crunch**: With limited hours in a day, it's not just about finding time to study, but also finding time to seek help when you're stuck.

- **Limited Guidance**: While some students may have regular access to tutors, mentors, or knowledgeable peers, others often find themselves trying to solve tough problems alone.

- **Vague Study Guides**: Nothing's worse than ambiguous or poorly-structured study materials. They can leave you more confused than before you started.

Worst of all, if a lecture wasn't recorded or you missed a class, you're out of luck. You'll have to rely on your notes, which may be incomplete or inaccurate.

## What?

Sitting through lectures and visiting office hours can only get you so far. This is where this documentation website comes in. Every developer is familiar with the power of documentation. It's a great way to learn about a new library, framework, or language. But what about data structures? Even more, what about for a specific course? Why not have a documentation website for that?

This website should empower you to:

- **Study Anywhere**: Whether you're at home, at work, or on the go, you can access this website from any device with an internet connection.
- **Study Specific Topics**: You can jump straight to the topic you're interested in, without having to sift through irrelevant material.

  - You can do this by using the sidebar table of contents (TOC) at the left which shows the topics available on the website or the TOC to the right which shows the topics discussed in the current page (ONLY AVAILABLE ON DESKTOP).
  - Also, you can use the search bar at the top to search for a specific keyword or topic.

- **Study at Your Own Pace**: You can study at your own pace, without having to worry about missing a lecture or office hours.

## Roadmap

We give you the ability to study at your own pace by providing you documentation for each topic covered in the course. For those who would like a structured format, we provide a suggested roadmap for studying the the material in this documentation:
